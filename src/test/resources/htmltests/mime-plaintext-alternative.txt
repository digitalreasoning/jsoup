As has been said, "Rubbish Bin" sounds a little like naming Nautilus "File
Cabinet" and the GIMP as "Artist's Workshop": it's nice to have a metaphor
(Heil HIG!) but it doesn't work very well here.

Google uses Deleted Items for GMail's "trash" folder. I think we should move
away from the bin metaphor and instead use something like "deleted items"
which is unambiguous.
