[OT] This is the way that X handles its clipboard. You can get around it 
by
using a clipboard manager like Klipper.

A hard disc is still made of discs.
I agree on the "program" bit, although this is just an americanisation as 
the original spelling was programme, i.e . a programme of instructions 
rather than a single one.
I spell the verb "plug in" and the computer noun "plugin" - for me there 
is no "plug-in".


  Is this 'computer separation' the way it is 'supposed' to be, or just 
the
influence of the USA over the computer industry from its youth?

en-US has that distinction as well. "Gasoline" directly maps to "Petrol",
and "Diesel" is the same in both languages (AFAIK).

Yes, but Bill Gates is a ruthlessly capitalistic tit.
