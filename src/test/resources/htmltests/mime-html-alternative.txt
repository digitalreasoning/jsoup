&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I definitely prefer 'rubbish bin', but that's just me, I suppose. Around<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; here, at least, noone refers to anything except 'rubbish' and 'rubbish<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bin', never 'garbage' or 'trash'. 'Wastebasket': I agree with what you
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; said on that.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; In that case, I propose that the entries in the &quot;Dialectical Differences&quot;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; table remain the same, apart from &quot;Wastebasket&quot; which should become
<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rubbish Bin&quot;. Since we have already been using Wastebasket in our Dapper<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; translations, I suggest that this change takes place as of Edgy.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts on this?
<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Where is the precedent for using &quot;Rubbish Bin&quot; in an operating system?&nbsp;&nbsp;It<br>&gt; &gt; sounds awfully unprofessional sounding to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know &quot;Trash&quot; sounds no<br>&gt; &gt; better, but can you imagine someone's face when they install an OS,
<br>&gt; &gt; selecting en-GB, and seeing &quot;Rubbish Bin&quot; on their desktop?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the whole, the effect is no different from &quot;Wastebasket&quot;, &quot;Recycle Bin&quot;, or<br>&gt; as you yourself have mentioned, &quot;Trash&quot;. My point is that &quot;Wastebasket&quot;
<br>&gt; sounds odd in many places but AFAIK &quot;Rubbish Bin&quot; is quite universal<br>&gt; worldwide (including the UK).<br><br>I must agree that here - in Kent - Wastebasket sounds odd to me. I have<br>never said it; but when reading the word, it's just rather a mouthful.
<br>I'd much agree that &quot;Rubbish Bin&quot; is much better, but a bit lengthy. It<br>may also sound a bit alien to the conservative; who (at least here) know<br>of the Rubbish Bin as the green &quot;wheelie bin&quot;. Just &quot;Rubbish&quot; is
<br>probably better still, but still carries a strange feel to it. Trash is<br>definitely a no-go, though.</blockquote></span></div><div><div><br>As has been said, &quot;Rubbish Bin&quot; sounds a little like naming Nautilus &quot;File Cabinet&quot; and the GIMP as &quot;Artist's Workshop&quot;: it's nice to have a metaphor (Heil HIG!) but it doesn't work very well here.
<br><br>Google uses Deleted Items for GMail's &quot;trash&quot; folder. I think we should move away from the bin metaphor and instead use something like &quot;deleted items&quot; which is unambiguous.<br clear="all"></div>
