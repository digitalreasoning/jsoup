<br>&gt; had a compact disc, etc). Plugin/Plug-in is also contextual. Plugin<br>&gt; being a computer application add-on while plug-in refers to an action &quot;I<br>&gt; am going to plug-in my new mouse&quot; etc. Programme and Program are also
<br>&gt; computer separated, with Programme referring to a TV programme (ex) and<br>&gt; Program being a computer program, i.e. &quot;I was watching a programme on<br>&gt; TV&quot; and &quot;Ben was getting annoyed with the Linux program clearing his

&nbsp;Is this 'computer separation' the way it is 'supposed' to be, or just the<br>influence of the USA over the computer industry from its youth?<br><br>&gt; Be careful that over
here we don't just call<br>&gt; everything &quot;gasoline&quot; too, petroleum is petrol and diesel is diesel.
<br><br>en-US has that distinction as well. &quot;Gasoline&quot; directly maps to &quot;Petrol&quot;,<br>and &quot;Diesel&quot; is the same in both languages (AFAIK).<br><br>--<br>Sridhar Dhanapalan<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;{GnuPG/OpenPGP:
